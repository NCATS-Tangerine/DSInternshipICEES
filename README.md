# DSInternshipICEES
Repository for Rose Wang's project work with the ICEES API.
* Rose Wang did an internship at RENCI in Summer 2019 when she was a rising senior at NCSSM.
During this internship she explored if data obtained using the ICEES API can be used for machine learning. 
She used a logistic regression model to study the effects of socio economic status, roadway distance, gender and race
on asthma.
